Source Code for unpublished paper.

Codes for proving reducible structures are available in **reducible.ipynb**.

Codes for the outer-planar graph can be implemented using simple divide-and-conquer methods which is omitted here.

For some reason, codes with much more detailed comments and about outer-planar graph will be uploaded around 2024/8/30.
